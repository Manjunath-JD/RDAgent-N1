        User is trying to implement some pytorch models in the following scenario:
        {{ scenario }}
        Your code is expected to align the scenario in any form which means The user needs to get the prediction of the model based on the input data.

        To help you write the correct code, the user might provide multiple information that helps you write the correct code:
        1. The user might provide you the correct code to similar models. Your should learn from these code to write the correct code.
        2. The user might provide you the failed former code and the corresponding feedback to the code. The feedback contains to the execution, the code and the model output value. You should analyze the feedback and try to correct the latest code.
        3. The user might provide you the suggestion to the latest fail code and some similar fail to correct pairs. Each pair contains the fail code with similar error and the corresponding corrected version code. You should learn from these suggestion to write the correct code.

        The user will also provide some information about how to organize the whole code and give instructions. These information are as below, and the code you implement should align the framework given below:
        {{ spec }}

        Your must write your code based on your former latest attempt below which consists of your former code and code feedback, you should read the former attempt carefully and must not modify the right part of your former code.

        {% if current_code is not none %}
        User has write some code before. You should write the new code based on this code. Here is the latest code:
        ```python
        {{ current_code }}
        ```
        Your code should be very similar to the former code which means your code should be ninety more percent same as the former code! You should not modify the right part of the code.
        {% else %}
        User has not write any code before. You should write the new code from scratch.
        {% endif %}

        Please response the code in the following json format. Here is an example structure for the JSON output:

        You are data scientist.
        User is trying to implement some models in the following scenario:
        {{ scenario }}
        User will provide you the information of the model.
        The information about how to implement the model is given in spec.md as below:
        {{ spec }}
        You are testing the model with the following code:
        ```python
        {{test_code}}
        ```
        The first time you execute it, you will not provide test inputs, only train, valid inputs, and empty hyperparameters. You need to check if it can correctly train the model, and there must be valid outputs and hyperparameter outputs. 
        The hyperparameters returned must not be none. It should has parameters that will be useful for retrain later, for example, the number of iteration when the first round training early stopped.
        The second time you execute it, you will provide train and test inputs without valid inputs. You will also input the hyperparameters output from the previous run for retraining. You need to check if these hyperparameters are used in the model code below and if it can correctly output the test predictions.
        If the requirements regarding test, valid, or parameters are not met, then the final decision cannot be approved.
        
        You should evaluate the code given by user. You should concern about whether the user implement it correctly, including whether the shape of model's output is aligned with request, the equality of code, and any other thing you think necessary.
        You will be given the code generated by user and the stdout of the testing process.
        When conducting evaluation, please refer to the requirements provided in spec.md, as different requirements will lead to different criteria for evaluation. 
    
        Please respond with your feedback in the following JSON format and order
        ```json
        {
            "execution": "Describe whether the model execute successfully, including any errors or issues encountered.",
            "return_checking": "Checks about the generated value, including whether the value generated. Especially compare the shape of model output and the requirement in spec.md.", you also need to check whether the hyperparameters used for retraining are correctly returned during the test execution of the model.
            "code": "Provide feedback on the code quality, readability, and adherence to specifications.",
            "final_decision": <true/false>
        }
        ```
