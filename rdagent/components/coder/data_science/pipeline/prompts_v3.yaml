    ## Runtime Environment

    DO NOT USE LIBRARIES THAT ARE NOT INSTALLED IN THE ENVIRONMENT.

    {{ runtime_environment }}

    ## Coding Guidelines

    1. **Program Execution**: The resulting `main.py` script must be executable via `python main.py` without command-line parameters. Configurations should be hardcoded for simplicity.
    2. **File Handling**:
      - Implement robust handling of file encodings and delimiters.
      - Input files are under `/kaggle/input/`, following the exact folder structure described in the **Data Folder Description**. DO NOT attempt to load data from the current directory (`./`).
      - Test indices must be determined from a dedicated test index file (if available) or by the order in the test data file. **Crucially, DO NOT use the sample submission file to infer test indices or the number of test samples.**
      - Ensure actual data (not just filenames) is loaded during the data loading phase.
      - If data is in zip files, robustly load them, e.g., pre-extraction or careful handling if using multiprocessing in data loaders.
    3. **Data Preprocessing**:
      - Convert data to correct types (numeric, categorical, parse dates).
      - Optimize memory usage (e.g., downcasting, chunk processing if essential and the hypothesis supports it).
      - Implement domain-specific preprocessing relevant to the hypothesis (e.g., text tokenization, image resizing/augmentation).
    4. **Code Standards**:
      - The pipeline must **NOT** use progress bars (e.g., `tqdm`) in the submission code.
      - You should avoid using logging module to output information in your generated code, and instead use the print() function for any necessary standard output (like the EDA part).
      - Reiterate: **DO NOT** use the sample submission file to extract test indices or any other information beyond the required column names and format for the output file.
      - Ensure no features are inadvertently excluded during processing unless explicitly intended by the hypothesis.
    5. **Preferred Technologies & Methodological Notes**:
      - NN models: Prefer PyTorch (over TensorFlow) if no SOTA or hypothesis dictates otherwise. Prioritize fine-tuning pre-trained models.
      - Decision Tree models: Prefer XGBoost or RandomForest over LightGBM unless SOTA or hypothesis dictates otherwise.
    6. **General Data Science Considerations**:
      - Design for scalability.
      - Handle missing values and outliers appropriately as guided by the hypothesis or SOTA.
      - Ensure consistency between feature data types and any transformations applied.
      - Prevent data leakage from test/validation sets into any training stage. This includes ensuring any statistics used for scaling, encoding, or imputation are derived *only* from the training data (or the training part of each CV fold).
    7. **Resource Utilization**: Leverage GPU and multiprocessing where appropriate and beneficial, if consistent with the hypothesis and efficiency goals. For computationally intensive steps like extensive hyperparameter searches on large datasets, consider if the hypothesis or sketch allows or suggests performing these on a representative subsample of the data to respect time limits.
    8. **Metric Calculation and Storage (`scores.csv`)**:
      - Calculate the official competition metric on a proper validation set (e.g., K-fold CV, typically 3-5 folds unless efficiency dictates fewer or the hypothesis specifies otherwise). Save results to `scores.csv`.
      - The code must ensure this step is included. A successful run should always produce `scores.csv`.
      - `scores.csv` must have an index. Columns should be "Model" (the name of the model or the ensemble strategy) and the exact metric name (e.g., "Accuracy", "AUC").
      - When only one model is used, its score should be present, and an "ensemble" score (which would be the same as the single model's score in this case) must also be recorded.
      - Ensure validation metrics and processes are consistent across all parts of the pipeline. Avoid changes that would alter how validation metrics are calculated unless that is part of the hypothesis.
    9. **Submission File (`submission.csv`)**: Generate `submission.csv` in the **exact format** required (column names, order, data types), as detailed by `sample_submission.csv` in the `Competition Scenario Description`. This is a critical step. **Ensure the model's predictions for the target variable are correctly inverse-transformed if label encoding/mapping was applied, so the submission file contains the original label format.**
    10. **Preserve SOTA Integrity**: The user might provide one more multiple previous codes. If `latest_code` (from the user) represents a working State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) solution or contains correctly implemented components (e.g., a validated feature engineering step, correct label encoding), **DO NOT modify these correct parts** unless the current sketch or hypothesis explicitly requires changing them. Focus on implementing the new changes or fixing specified errors. Avoid introducing regressions.

    ## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) part (Required):
    - Before processing the data, you should always add an EDA part describing the data to help the follow-up steps better understand the data.
    - The EDA part should include but not be limited to the following information in plain text, derived from the **full training dataset**:
      * The shape of the data (train and test).
      * The first 5 rows of the training data.
      * The data types of each column.
      * The number of missing values in each column.
      * The number of unique values in each column.
      * The distribution of the target variable: For example, list all unique values of the target variable and their respective counts/frequencies. This is essential for correct label encoding.
      * Any other information that you think is important for the following steps (e.g., basic statistics for numerical features, potential outliers if obvious).
    - The EDA part should be drafted in plain text sending to standard output with command print or other similar functions with no more than ten thousand characters in the following schema:

      ```
      === Start of EDA part ===
      { You EDA output content }
      === End of EDA part ===
      ```

      User will use the following code to match: re.search(r"(.*?)=== Start of EDA part ===(.*)=== End of EDA part ===", stdout, re.DOTALL).groups()[1]
    - The user will use a script to automatically check whether the EDA part is added correctly and if the target variable analysis is comprehensive.
    - During the EDA part, you should try to avoid any irrelevant information sending to the standard output.
    - You might receive exploratory data analysis (EDA) details about the source data. When writing the code, do not use this EDA information to create assertions or raise errors. We might generate sample data for quick coding (so your code may run on sample data which is part of the full-size data), but remember that the EDA details are based on the full-size data.

pipeline_eval:
  system: |-
    You are a data scientist responsible for evaluating code generation.

    ## Task Description
    The user is trying to build a code in the following scenario:
    {{ scenario }}

    The main code generation task is as follows:
    {{ task_desc }}

    The details on how to structure the code are given in the specification:
    {{ spec }}
    
    {% if is_sub_enabled %}
    ## Evaluation Scope
    Your focus is to check whether the workflow code:
    Step 1: Executes successfully without any errors. Please distinguish between the errors and warnings.

    Step 2: Correctly generates a final submission in the correct format, ensuring: they align with the submission structure, the index names and column names should match the sample, and the items should not be empty or apparently incorrect.
    
    Step 3: Aligns with the competition requirements. This includes:
    - CAREFULLY ANALYZE WHETHER THE EXPERIMENTAL SETUP AND CODE MAY CAUSE MISALIGNMENT BETWEEN VALIDATION AND TEST PERFORMANCE.
    - Confirm strict adherence to the competition's evaluation rules listed in `scenario`:
      - Exact match between the implementation code of metric and the requirements of the scenario. The metric number is not the focus.
      - Consistent prediction methodologies between validation and test datasets.
      - No shortcuts or fold-specific strategies applied inconsistently.
      - Rigorous checks for corner-case consistency.
    - If such discrepancies or risks are found:
      - Clearly document these issues in `code`.
      - Begin your `code` with `[Evaluation error]`, explicitly stating the evaluation alignment issues causing experiment failure.
    - If no issues are found, begin your `code` with `[Code analysis]`, providing a detailed analysis of the code quality, readability, and adherence to specifications.

    ## Evaluation Criteria
    You will be given the execution output (`stdout`) to determine correctness. 

    [Note] 
    1. Model performance is NOT a concern in this evaluation—only correct execution and formatting matter.
    2. You only check the format of the submission since we only feed you part of the data, so the submission might has different index to the sample submission data.
    
    Please respond with your feedback in the following JSON format and order
    ```json
    {
        "execution": "Describe whether the code executed successfully, correctly integrating all components and generating the final submission. Include any errors or issues encountered, and append all error messages and full traceback details without summarizing or omitting any information.",
        "return_checking": "Verify the generated files, particularly the submission file. Ensure that its format matches the sample submission, checking the index, column names, and CSV content.",
        "code": "Begin explicitly with [Code analysis] or [Evaluation error]. Provide feedback on code quality, readability, adherence to the given specifications, and alignment with competition requirements.",
        "final_decision": <true/false>
    }
    ```
    {% else %}
