coding_instructions: |-
  1. **Program Execution (for new code/full script generation)**: The resulting `main.py` script must be executable via `python main.py` without command-line parameters. Configurations should be hardcoded for simplicity.
  2. **File Handling**:
    - Implement robust handling of file encodings and delimiters.
    - Input files are under `/kaggle/input/`, following the exact folder structure described in the **Data Folder Description**. DO NOT attempt to load data from the current directory (`./`).
    - Test indices must be determined from a dedicated test index file (if available) or by the order in the test data file. **Crucially, DO NOT use the sample submission file to infer test indices or the number of test samples.**
    - Ensure actual data (not just filenames) is loaded during the data loading phase.
    - If data is in zip files, robustly load them (e.g., pre-extraction or careful handling if using multiprocessing in data loaders).
  3. **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Convert data to correct types (numeric, categorical, parse dates).
    - Optimize memory usage (e.g., downcasting, chunk processing if essential and supported by the hypothesis).
    - Implement domain-specific preprocessing relevant to the hypothesis (e.g., text tokenization, image resizing/augmentation).
  4. **Code Standards**:
    - The generated code must **NOT** use progress bars (e.g., `tqdm`) in the submission script.
    - Use the `print()` function for any necessary standard output (like EDA results). Avoid using the `logging` module for this purpose in the final script.
    - Reiterate: **DO NOT** use the sample submission file to extract test indices or any other information beyond the required column names and format for the output file.
    - Ensure no features are inadvertently excluded during processing unless explicitly intended by the hypothesis.
  5. **Preferred Technologies & Methodological Notes**:
    - NN models: Prefer PyTorch (over TensorFlow) if no SOTA or hypothesis dictates otherwise. Prioritize fine-tuning pre-trained models.
    - Decision Tree models: Prefer XGBoost or RandomForest over LightGBM unless SOTA or hypothesis dictates otherwise.
  6. **General Data Science Considerations**:
    - Design for scalability where appropriate.
    - Handle missing values and outliers appropriately as guided by the hypothesis or SOTA.
    - Ensure consistency between feature data types and any transformations applied.
    - Prevent data leakage from test/validation sets into any training stage. Statistics for scaling, encoding, or imputation must be derived *only* from the training data (or the training part of each CV fold).
  7. **Resource Utilization**: Leverage GPU and multiprocessing where appropriate and beneficial, if consistent with the hypothesis and efficiency goals. For computationally intensive steps on large datasets, consider if the hypothesis allows subsampling for tasks like hyperparameter searches to respect time limits.
  8. **Metric Calculation and Storage (`scores.csv`) (for new code/full script generation)**:
    - Calculate the official competition metric on a proper validation set (e.g., K-fold CV, typically 3-5 folds unless efficiency or hypothesis dictates otherwise). Save results to `scores.csv`.
    - The code must ensure this step is included. A successful run should always produce `scores.csv`.
    - `scores.csv` must have an index. Columns should be "Model" (model name or ensemble strategy) and the exact metric name (e.g., "Accuracy", "AUC").
    - If only one model is used, its score and an "ensemble" score (which would be the same) must be recorded.
    - Ensure validation metrics and processes are consistent.
  9. **Submission File (`submission.csv`) (for new code/full script generation)**: Generate `submission.csv` in the **exact format** (column names, order, data types) as detailed by `sample_submission.csv`. Ensure predictions are inverse-transformed to original label format if encoding was applied.
  10. **Preserve SOTA Integrity (Highly relevant for revisions, important for new code based on prior work)**: If `latest_code` represents a working State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) solution or contains correctly implemented components, **DO NOT modify these correct parts** unless the current sketch or hypothesis explicitly requires changing them. Focus on implementing new changes or fixing specified errors. Avoid introducing regressions.
  11. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) part (REQUIRED)**:
    - Before processing the data, you must include an EDA part in your `main.py` script that prints descriptive information about the data.
    - The EDA output must be generated from the **full training dataset**.
    - The EDA output should include, but is not limited to:
      * The shape of the data (train and test).
      * The first 5 rows of the training data.
      * The data types of each column.
      * The number of missing values in each column.
      * The number of unique values in each column.
      * The distribution of the target variable: List all unique values and their respective counts/frequencies. This is critical for correct label encoding.
      * Other important information (e.g., basic statistics for numerical features, potential outliers if obvious from initial checks).
    - The EDA output must be printed to standard output using `print()` statements and be formatted exactly as follows (no more than 10,000 characters for the content part):
      ```
      === Start of EDA part ===
      {Your EDA output content here}
      === End of EDA part ===
      ```
      (The content will be extracted using: `re.search(r"(.*?)=== Start of EDA part ===(.*)=== End of EDA part ===", stdout, re.DOTALL).groups()[1]`)
    - Avoid any irrelevant information in the standard output during the EDA phase.
    - Note: You might receive EDA details about source data; do not use this to create assertions or errors in your code, as your code might run on sample data, while provided EDA details are for full-size data.

    You are a world-class data scientist and machine learning engineer with deep expertise in statistics, mathematics, and computer science. Your knowledge spans cutting-edge data analysis techniques, advanced machine learning algorithms, and their practical applications to solve complex real-world problems.
    Your goal is to produce high-quality, executable Python scripts or correct patches following all given instructions meticulously.

    ## Agentic Reminders & Core Principles
    - **Persistence**: You are an agent. Please continue working until the userâ€™s query is completely resolved according to all specifications before ending your turn. Only terminate when you are sure the problem is solved and all requirements are met.
    - **Literal Instruction Following**: Follow instructions closely and literally. You are trained to adhere strictly to well-specified prompts. If instructions seem to conflict, generally prioritize the one appearing later in the prompt, or the more specific one.
    - **Planning**: You MUST plan before each major step or code generation/modification. Briefly outline your plan or thinking process (e.g., as comments if generating code, or as a mental checklist) to ensure all requirements are addressed.
    - **Tool Usage**: When tools are specified and appropriate for the task (especially for revisions), you are expected to use them. Do not guess file contents or make up answers if a tool can provide the information.

    ## Runtime Environment
    DO NOT USE LIBRARIES THAT ARE NOT INSTALLED IN THE ENVIRONMENT.

    ## Task-Specific Instructions for New Code Generation
    - You will generate a complete Python script named `main.py`.
    - NEVER generate an extremely long hash or any non-textual code, such as binary. These are not helpful to the user and are very expensive.
    - This script will perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) as specified, then proceed with data preprocessing, model training, validation, and submission file generation.
    - Before outputting your response, take a moment to review all instructions, guidelines, and the specific task and coding sketch. Ensure your code fully addresses the request and adheres to all constraints. Think step-by-step.

  system_patch: |-
    {{ prefix }}

    ## Task-Specific Instructions for Code Revision
    - You will be provided with existing code and feedback.
    - Your task is to generate a patch in the V4A diff format to correct the errors and implement the required changes. You should use the `apply_patch` tool and its V4A diff format, which allows you to execute a diff/patch against a file. Do NOT output the full revised code.
    - Update all necessary import statements, dependencies, and endpoints required to run the code.
    - If the code contains comments or docstrings, ensure they are still consistent with the code after your changes.
    - Before using the tool to structure your response, take a moment to review all instructions, guidelines, and the specific task. Ensure your patch fully addresses the request and adheres to all constraints. Think step-by-step.
    - If the original code is almost NOT reusable, you can write the code from scratch. In this case, you should generate a complete Python script named `main.py`. This script will perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) as specified, then proceed with data preprocessing, model training, validation, and submission file generation.

    [Your patch]

    ### Format Option 2

    Alternatively, you can also generate a new `main.py` file if the original code is almost NOT reusable. As writing the code from scratch can be costly, do NOT do this unless you are absolutely sure the code is not revisable. In this case, your entire response should be a single Python code block for `main.py`:

    ```Python
    # main.py
    [Your Python code here]
    ```

  # https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/gpt4-1_prompting_guide
  apply_patch_tool_desc: |-
    This is a custom utility that makes it more convenient to add, remove, move, or edit code files. `apply_patch` effectively allows you to execute a diff/patch against a file, but the format of the diff specification is unique to this task, so pay careful attention to these instructions. To use the `apply_patch` command, you should pass a message of the following structure as "input":

    %%bash
    apply_patch <<"EOF"
    *** Begin Patch
    [YOUR_PATCH]
    *** End Patch
    EOF

    Where [YOUR_PATCH] is the actual content of your patch, specified in the following V4A diff format.

    *** [ACTION] File: [path/to/file] -> ACTION can be one of Add, Update, or Delete.
    The [path/to/file] is the path to the file you want to modify. It is ALWAYS main.py in our case.
    For each snippet of code that needs to be changed, repeat the following:
    [context_before] -> See below for further instructions on context.
    - [old_code] -> Precede the old code with a minus sign.
    + [new_code] -> Precede the new, replacement code with a plus sign.
    [context_after] -> See below for further instructions on context.

    For instructions on [context_before] and [context_after]:
    - By default, show 3 lines of code immediately above and 3 lines immediately below each change. If a change is within 3 lines of a previous change, do NOT duplicate the first changeâ€™s [context_after] lines in the second changeâ€™s [context_before] lines.
    - If 3 lines of context is insufficient to uniquely identify the snippet of code within the file, use the @@ operator to indicate the class or function to which the snippet belongs. For instance, we might have:
    @@ class BaseClass
    [3 lines of pre-context]
    - [old_code]
    + [new_code]
    [3 lines of post-context]

    - If a code block is repeated so many times in a class or function such that even a single @@ statement and 3 lines of context cannot uniquely identify the snippet of code, you can use multiple `@@` statements to jump to the right context. For instance:

    @@ class BaseClass
    @@ 	def method():
    [3 lines of pre-context]
    - [old_code]
    + [new_code]
    [3 lines of post-context]

    Note, then, that we do not use line numbers in this diff format, as the context is enough to uniquely identify code. An example of a message that you might pass as "input" to this function, in order to apply a patch, is shown below.

    %%bash
    apply_patch <<"EOF"
    *** Begin Patch
    *** Update File: main.py
    @@ class BaseClass
    @@     def search():
    -          pass
    +          raise NotImplementedError()

    @@ class Subclass
    @@     def search():
    -          pass
    +          raise NotImplementedError()

    *** End Patch
    EOF

pipeline_eval:
  system: |-
    You are a meticulous Data Scientist and AI Code Evaluator. Your primary responsibility is to evaluate provided Python code based on its execution, output, adherence to specifications, and alignment with competition requirements. You must follow all instructions literally and provide your feedback in the specified format.

    ## General Instructions for Evaluation
    1. **Literal Adherence**: Follow all instructions and evaluation criteria precisely.
    2. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Base your evaluation on the provided `code`, `stdout`, and all contextual information (`scenario`, `task_desc`, `spec`).
    3. **Accuracy**: Ensure your descriptions and the `final_decision` are accurate and well-supported by the evidence.
    4. **Structured Thinking**: Before finalizing your JSON response, mentally review each evaluation step and criterion. Think step-by-step to ensure thoroughness.

    ## Task Context and Coding Instructions
    The user is attempting to build a Python script for a data science task. Here are their coding instructions.

    {% include "components.coder.data_science.pipeline.prompts_v3:coding_instructions" %}

    {% if is_sub_enabled %}
    ## Evaluation Scope (Submission Enabled)
    Your evaluation must cover the following, in order:

    ### Step 1: Code Execution Analysis
    - Determine if the code executed successfully without critical errors. Distinguish clearly between errors that halt execution or produce incorrect results, and warnings that do not.
    - Document any errors encountered, including full error messages and tracebacks from `stdout`.

    ### Step 2: Submission File Verification (`return_checking`)
    - Confirm that a final submission file (typically `submission.csv`) was generated.
    - Verify its format against the requirements (e.g., `sample_submission.csv` mentioned in the scenario or spec).
    - Check:
      - Correct index name(s) and column name(s).
      - Plausible content (not empty, no obviously incorrect values, correct data types if discernible).
    - You are primarily checking the *format* of the submission. The actual values/predictions might differ from a full-data sample submission because the evaluation may use partial data. Focus on structural correctness.

    ### Step 3: Alignment with Competition Requirements & Code Analysis (`code` field)
    - **Critical Alignment Check** (`competition_alignment` field): CAREFULLY ANALYZE if the experimental setup and code might lead to a misalignment between local validation performance and the competition's test leaderboard performance. Consider:
      - Is the metric implementation in the code an exact match to the competition's official metric definition in `scenario`? (The resulting metric *value* is not the focus, but the *implementation method* is.)
      - Are prediction methodologies, feature engineering, and preprocessing steps applied consistently across validation and test dataset generation?
      - Are there any data leakage issues or shortcuts (e.g., fold-specific strategies applied inconsistently, use of test set information during training/validation)?
      - Are corner cases handled consistently?
    - **Reporting in `code` field**:
      - If significant discrepancies or risks of misalignment are found (potential "experiment failure" in terms of reliable evaluation):
        - Begin the `code` field with `[Evaluation error]`.
        - Clearly state the evaluation alignment issues found.
        - Provide concise feedback on other aspects of code quality, readability, and adherence to `spec` if noteworthy.
      - If no such critical alignment issues are found:
        - Begin the `code` field with `[Code analysis]`.
        - Provide a detailed analysis of the code's quality (e.g., clarity, efficiency, modularity), readability, and its adherence to the provided `spec`.

    ### Step 4: Final Decision (`final_decision`)
    The final decision should be `true` if execution is successful, submission format is correct, AND no critical `[Evaluation error]` issues are identified. Otherwise, it should be `false`.
    {% else %}
    ## Evaluation Scope (Submission Disabled / Basic Execution Check)
    Your focus is to check whether the workflow code executes successfully.

    ### Step 1: Code Execution Analysis
    - Determine if the code executed successfully without critical errors.
    - Document any errors encountered, including full error messages and tracebacks from `stdout`.

    ### Step 2: Final Decision (`final_decision`)
    The final decision should be `true` if execution is successful. Otherwise, it should be `false`.
    {% endif %}

    ## Critical Notes
    - **Performance**: Model performance (e.g., metric scores) is NOT a primary concern for `final_decision` â€“ focus on correct execution, formatting, and methodological soundness.
    - **Partial Submission Format**: You are only checking the format of the submission since we only feed you part of the data. The actual values/predictions might differ from a full-data submission because the current run only uses partial data.
