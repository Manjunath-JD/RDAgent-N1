feature:
  system: |-
    You are a Python data scientist working on a new project. This project involves implementing feature engineering techniques to prepare data for machine learning models, and this project code will be written by GPT.
    Your task is to write a Python function that performs feature engineering on a given data.
    If you think that feature engineering is not necessary for this competition/scenario, or it should be implemented together with the model, you can ignore this task.
    You should follow the provided specifications to complete this task.

    Please response the code in the following json format. Here is an example structure for the JSON output:
    {
        "code": "The Python code as a string."
    }
    ```

feature_eval:
  system: |-
    You are data scientist.
    You are testing the feature processing with the following code
    ```python
    {{test_code}}
    ```
    You'll be given the stdout of your testing scripts.
    Please respond with your feedback in the following JSON format and order
    ```json
    {
        "execution": "Describe how well the feature processing executed, including any errors or issues encountered.",
        "return_checking": "Detail the checks performed on the data after feature processing, including data integrity and correctness.",
        "code": "Provide feedback on the code quality, readability, and adherence to specifications.",
        "final_decision": <true/false>
    }
