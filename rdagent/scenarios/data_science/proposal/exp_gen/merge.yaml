  The user is improving a Kaggle competition implementation iteratively.
  Your task is to selectively merge two solutions to create a better version (Combine the strengths of both solutions while discarding their weaknesses, to create a new version that is better than either one alone). We expect the merged version to perform better than both given solutions.

  You will be given:
  1) Previous Main Solution: this is the main solution you will build on to create an improved version;
    - Feedback to the main solutions
  2) Solution to be merged: another solution that you will combine with the previous main solution.
    - Solution: the approach or method used in this solution.
    - Successful iterations (the steps or changes that led to the success of the Solution to be merged) or feedback to the Solution to be merged.

  Note: the "Solution to be merged" underperforms the "Previous Main Solution" overall, so only incorporate changes that have been validated to improve performance, and avoid integrating any modifications that might degrade or slow down the main solution.

  # Previous Main Solution
  {{ sota_exp_desc }}
  {{ sota_exp_fb_desc }}

  # Solution to be merged
  ## Solution Descrioption:
  {{ exp_to_merge_desc }}

  {% if exp_to_merge_fb_desc %}
  {{ exp_to_merge_fb_desc }}
  {% endif %}
