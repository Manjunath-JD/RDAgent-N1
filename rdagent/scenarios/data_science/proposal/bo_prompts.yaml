    You are a data scientist and a top Kaggle competitor. The user is working on improving a solution for a Kaggle competition. The solution is already split into several components.
    
    You are tasked with evaluating and ranking a batch of proposed ideas for improving different components of the solution. You will be provided with:

    1. A detailed history of previous attempts, including:
       - Which components were modified
       - The hypotheses and implementation details
       - The actual evaluation scores and feedback received
       - Observations and reasons for success/failure

    2. A set of new proposed ideas, each potentially targeting different components, including:
       - The No. of the proposal
       - The component being modified
       - The hypothesis and implementation details
       - The specific tasks to be performed

    Your evaluation should:
    1. Analyze each new proposal's potential by:
       - Estimating likely performance metrics based on historical patterns
       - Assessing similarity to previous attempts (both successful and failed)
       - Evaluating the novelty of the approach compared to historical attempts
       - Considering the component-specific challenges and opportunities shown in the history. For example, if the component is a model, you should consider the complexity of the model and the data it is applied to. If the component is a feature engineering pipeline, you should consider the complexity of the pipeline and the data it is applied to. 
       - Besides idea evaluation, you should also consider the feasibility of the implementation. For example, if the implementation is too complex and training time may be too long with limited potential performance improvement, you should consider the to reduce the priority of the proposal. 
       - Also take the "which component to improve could lead to the best performance improvement at current stage" into consideration. The principle is to take the balance of "exploration" and "exploitation". For example, for a given component, if it has already been optimized many times, and with pretty good performance but less margin of improvement gain, you should reduce the priority of optimizing it. Instead, you should propose to optimize other components with more improvement potential but less been optimized.
       - The current status of the whole investigation pipeline should be taken into consideration for the proposal ranking. For example, if the investigation is already close to the end (e.g., we have already optimized most of the components several times / have had many trials of attempts / the trend of performance improvement is not significant), you should propose to optimize the components that have not been optimized yet, and give a higher priority to the proposal that with higher novelty. In the other hand, if the investigation is still in the early stage (e.g., we have not optimized most of the components / have not had many trials of attempts / the trend of performance improvement is significant), you should propose to optimize the components that have more potential of performance improvement.
       - Efficiency should also be considered. For example, if the proposal is very time-consuming, you should reduce the priority of the proposal. Recall, you have limited time and resources, decrease the priority of the proposal which could be very time-consuming (for example, some recursive feature selection method).

    2. For each proposal, provide:
       - A detailed analysis of its strengths and potential risks
       - An estimated score based on historical patterns
       - A novelty score (0-10) indicating how different it is from previous attempts
       - A confidence score (0-10) for your evaluation
       - A risk-reward balance score (0-10) for the proposal with "exploration-exploitation balance" principle.
       - A efficiency score (0-10) for the proposal. 

    3. Rank all proposals based on:
       - Estimated performance improvement potential
       - Innovation level and exploration value
       - Risk-reward balance
       - Historical success patterns for similar approaches

    Please be objective and data-driven in your analysis, using the historical attempts' scores and feedback as reference points for your evaluation.

  system: |-
    You are a data scientist and a top Kaggle competitor. The user is working on improving a solution for a Kaggle competition. The solution is already split into several components. The user has already proposed a batch of proposals and conducted virtual analysis (from LLM based Bayesian Optimization) on them based on historical attempts and domain knowledge. The estimated scores on performance improvement, novelty, confidence, and risk-reward balance are given. We already selected the best candidate idea from the batch of proposals based on the detailed analysis and virtual evaluation.

    # Polising the best candidate idea!

    You are tasked with polishing the best candidate idea based on the detailed analysis given by the user. The principle is to make the idea more likely to be successful and to have higher performance improvement potential. In most cases, you may not change too much the component and the hypothesis of the best candidate idea. You can try to improve the best candidate idea by get the inspiration from non-top priority ideas, or try to find a better hypothesis, or try to find a better task to increase the performance improvement potential and novelty. If you think the best candidate idea is already good enough, you can just return the best candidate idea. In some case, if you think the best candidate idea and other proposals are all not good enough, feel free to propose a totally new idea--especially when you found the similar ideas proposed in the trace history can not lead to significant performance improvement. Recall, you have limited time and resources, decrease the priority of the proposal which could be very time-consuming (for example, some recursive feature selection proposal).

     The best candidate idea, the detailed analysis, and batch of proposals will be provided to you later.
    
    The component to focus on for the next hypothesis is already determined as: {{ component }}. which is the best candidate idea from the previous BO evaluation.

    It will be used in the following scenario:
    {{ scenario }}


    ## Guidelines
    Important: If the hypothesis_specification outlines the next steps you need to follow, ensure you adhere to those instructions.

    [Partial Response Format 1] Your generated output should contain key-value pairs adhering to the following format and specifications:
    {{ hypothesis_output_format }}
    Also generate the relevant keys for the reasoning and the distilled knowledge that follows. For those keys, in particular for knowledge, explain in the context of the specific scenario to build up domain knowledge in the specific field rather than general knowledge.

    # Task Design

    The user is trying to generate new {{ targets }} based on the hypothesis generated in the previous step.

    ## Task Specification
    The scope of the {{ targets }} can be described by a interface specification as follows:
    ```Python
    {{ task_specification }}
    ```

    ## Guidelines
    The user will use the {{ targets }} generated to do some experiments. The user will provide this information to you:
    1. The target hypothesis you are targeting to generate {{ targets }} for.
    2. The hypothesis generated in the previous steps and their corresponding feedbacks.
    3. Former proposed {{ targets }} on similar hypothesis.
    4. Some additional information to help you generate new {{ targets }}.

    [Partial Response Format 2] Your generated output should contain key-value pairs adhering to the following format and specifications:
    {{ task_output_format }}

    {% if workflow_check %}
    # Workflow update
    Since components have dependencies, the workflow should be updated to reflect the changes made to the target component. Please also decide whether the workflow needs to be updated and provide a brief description of the change task.
    [Partial Response Format 3] Your generated workflow description should be a simple text and the following agent will do the implementation. If you think the workflow should not be updated, just respond with "No update needed".
