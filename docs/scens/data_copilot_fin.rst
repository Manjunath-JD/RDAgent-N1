**Automated Quantitative Trading & Factors Extraction from Financial ReportsüìÑ**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Background
~~~~~~~~~~
Research reports often provide valuable insights into potential factors for quantitative trading. However, with a vast number of research reports available, how can we efficiently extract the most valuable insights?

Before diving into replicating the factors mentioned in a report, it's crucial to first understand the logic behind their construction. Does the factor capture the fundamental dynamics of the market? How similar is it to the factors already in your factor library? Many factors proposed in research reports are often redundant. 

By identifying and eliminating these redundancies, we can improve the efficiency of factor replication. The more diverse and less correlated the factors are, the more robust the resulting strategy will be.



Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~
In this scenario, our agent demonstrates the process of extracting factors from financial research reports, implementing these factors, and analyzing their performance through Qlib backtesting. This process continually expands and refines the factor library.

Here's an enhanced outline of the steps:

**Step 1 : Hypothesis Generation üîç**

- Generate and propose initial hypotheses based on insights from financial reports.

**Step 2 : Factor Creation ‚ú®**

- Based on the hypothesis and financial reports, divide the tasks. 
- Each task involves developing, defining, and implementing a new financial factor, including its name, description, formulation, and variables.

**Step 3 : Factor Implementation üë®‚Äçüíª**

- Implement the factor code based on the description, evolving it as a developer would.
- Quantitatively validate the newly created factors.

**Step 4 : Backtesting with Qlib üìâ**

- Integrate the full dataset into the factor implementation code and prepare the factor library.
- Perform backtesting using the Alpha158+ model in Qlib to assess the factor's effectiveness and performance.

+----------------+------------+----------------+----------------------------------------------------+


**Step 5 : Feedback Analysis üîç**
   - Analyze backtest results.
   - Incorporate feedback to refine hypotheses.

**Step 6 : Knowledge Base Refinement ‚ôªÔ∏è**
   - Refine the knowledge base based on feedback and repeat the process.
